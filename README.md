# Laugh and Groan: AWS Serverless Architecture

This project is an ongoing exploration of what it takes to setup a production serverless workload in AWS to do something "productive". The site will be a place to post links you find around the internet that either make you "laugh" or "groan" that you can share with people.

## WIP

This is a work in progress and I'll be adding a lot more helpful documentation and such to it. (including how to deploy it yourself).
